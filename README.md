About P-GRe
===========
Pseudogenes are genomic sequences with homology to functional genes but that harbor deleterious mutations, such as loss of the start codon, loss of coding sequence, gain of stop or frame-shifts. The goal of PseudoGene REtriever (P-GRe) is to find the position of pseudogenes on a genome, as well as to infer their structures in pseudo-CDSs. P-GRe aims to be more user-friendly, with a limited number of dependencies, ease of use and total automaticity, while producing qualitative results and having greater sensitivity than other software with the same goal.
